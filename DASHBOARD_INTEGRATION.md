# PyUSD Dashboard Integration Complete

## What Was Done

‚úÖ **Successfully integrated the new PyUSD yield selector dashboard** as requested!

### Changes Made:

1. **Preserved Original Dashboard**

   - Moved original dashboard content from `/dashboard` to `/cookbook`
   - Updated metadata and layout accordingly
   - Old Privy auth demo is now accessible at `/cookbook`

2. **Created New PyUSD Dashboard**

   - Replaced `/dashboard` with the new PyUSD yield selector interface
   - Built custom UI components (Button, Card, Badge) using Tailwind CSS
   - Added proper styling with hover effects and transitions

3. **Added Required Dependencies**

   - Installed `lucide-react` for icons (ArrowRight, TrendingUp, Shield, Zap)
   - Installed `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for className utilities
   - Created `cn` utility function for conditional class names

4. **Fixed Configuration Issues**

   - Updated `tsconfig.json` with proper path mapping for `@/*` imports
   - Updated `next.config.js` with webpack alias configuration
   - Created `.env.local` with proper Privy environment variables

5. **Created Standalone Version**
   - Also created a standalone version at `/pyusd` that works independently
   - Both `/dashboard` and `/pyusd` now serve the same PyUSD interface
