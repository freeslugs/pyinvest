# Growth Vault Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Growth Vault functionality on the dashboard page with smart wallet integration for Sepolia testnet. The implementation includes balance checking, investment flow, and Uniswap V3 liquidity provision.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Vault Balance Display
- **Location**: Above the amount selection section in Growth Vault
- **Functionality**: Shows current number of Uniswap V3 positions held by the smart wallet
- **Data Source**: Position Manager NFT balance check
- **Display**: Shows position count (e.g., "2 Positions") with smart wallet address

### 2. Investment Flow
The "Invest $x" button now implements a complete 4-step investment process:

#### Step 1: MetaMask Balance Check & Transfer
- Checks if MetaMask wallet has sufficient PYUSD
- If available, transfers PYUSD from MetaMask to smart wallet
- Switches MetaMask to Sepolia network if needed

#### Step 2: Smart Wallet Balance Verification
- Verifies smart wallet has sufficient PYUSD for investment
- Throws error if insufficient balance

#### Step 3: Token Swap
- Swaps exactly half of the PYUSD to USDC using Uniswap V3
- Uses Universal Router for swap execution
- Applies slippage protection with conservative estimates
- All transactions signed by smart wallet

#### Step 4: Liquidity Provision
- Adds both PYUSD and USDC to Uniswap V3 PYUSD/USDC pool
- Creates full-range liquidity position
- Mints NFT position to smart wallet
- Uses Position Manager for liquidity addition

### 3. UI Improvements
- **Yield Active Toggle**: Commented out as requested
- **Investment Status**: Real-time status updates during investment process
- **Loading States**: Animated spinner and progress messages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error display with user-friendly messages
- **Button States**: Dynamic button text and disabled states during processing

### 4. Smart Wallet Integration
- **Network**: Sepolia testnet (Chain ID: 11155111)
- **Wallet**: Uses Privy smart wallet for all DeFi transactions
- **Signing**: All approvals, swaps, and liquidity additions signed by smart wallet
- **Balance Checking**: Real-time balance verification for both MetaMask and smart wallet
